## ðŸ“š Background

This project is part of my learning journey in deployment, inspired by a private workshop organized at ESTIN.  
It represents the practical exercises I followed to understand essential DevOps tools and concepts.

Throughout this project, I explored:

- Docker and containerization
- FastAPI backend for serving ML models
- Basic CI/CD workflows
- Introduction to Kubernetes deployments
